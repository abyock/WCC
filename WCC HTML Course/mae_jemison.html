    And so for me - having grown up on the South Side of Chicago going to public schools, having been a medical doctor, having worked in Cambodian refugee camps as well as being an engineer as well as being someone who was very versed in dance and the arts - yes, I'm supposed to bring those perspectives to bear on the questions that we ask about space exploration.

    Jemison responded to questions about her influences and motivations in an interview with National Public Radio that was broadcast on February 22, 2017 on the show <i>All Things Considered</i>. In this interview, Jemison notes that women, and particularly African-American women, involved in space science have achieved greater visibility to the public after the recent film, <i>Hidden Figures</i>. She notes that this is crucial because women of color have traditionally not been part of the national imagination in telling the story of the history of science, and in particular of space science and exploration.

    Jemison says, "Well, I think it's one of those things that really needs to be done . . . And this is because people of all types have made contributions across the spectrum of the sciences, across the spectrum of space exploration, and they have been left out many times, purposefully."<br>
    She continues, "I always think of it as like, 'What do you do with your place at the table?' If you act just like everyone else, what difference does it make that you're there? And so for me -- having grown up on the South Side of Chicago going to public schools, having been a medical doctor, having worked in Cambodian refugee camps as well as being an engineer as well as being someone who was very versed in dance and the arts -- yes, I'm supposed to bring those perspectives to bear on the questions that we ask about space exploration.
